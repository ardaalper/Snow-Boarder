This is the second Unity-based basic game project on my github account. I made 
this project in the tutorial of "Learn Unity in C# & Code Your First Five 2D 
Video Games for Web, Mac & PC. The Tutorials Cover Tilemap" from Udemy. I learnt
and applied the basic game concepts on Unity such as physics on moveable objects
and their aspects (triggers, effectors etc.). I get the deeper intuation of designing
game level and the imprving user expreience.
